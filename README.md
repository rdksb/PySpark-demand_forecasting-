# Use Spark MLlib to forecast e-commerce consumer demands 

This project illustrates how to use pyspark (Python API for Apache Spark) to preprocess large-scale datasets and build ML models.  

The dataset used for this project (Online Retail) comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). It contains transactional data, representing sales of an online retail outlet between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The forecasting models are trained on transactions occuring between 01/12/2010 and 01/10/2011, and then used to predict upcoming demand over the remaining period.
